This impacted their government in many ways: food rationing, extra taxes to the Czar, and the draft. The citizens of Russia really thought that this was a senseless conflict that Russians didn’t need to become a part of. When Czar Nicholas the II ignored calls to pull out of the war the citizens of Russia started to rebel. Protesting in rallies and marches all over Russia. This sent a clear message to Nicholas that the war must be stopped. Once again he persisted with carrying out the war. The protests were getting very violent, people were now carrying signs saying “Down with Nicholas.” After Russia was forced out of the war there was a siege of the palace with a result of Nicholas and his family being sent to jail. Some of the same attributes can be seen in the beginning of Animal Farm especially when the animals were trying to kick Mr. Jones out of the farm.</p><a href="../"><button class="ui left labeled icon button"><i class="left arrow icon"></i> Home</button></a></div></div><footer class="ui inverted vertical footer segment"><div class="ui container">Copyright Efram Stewart & Michael Clancy, 2017.</div></footer></div><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js integrity="sha256-BbhdlvQf/xTY9gja0Dq3HiwQF8LaCRTXxZKRutelT44=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.2.7/semantic.min.js integrity="sha256-flVaeawsBV96vCHiLmXn03IRJym7+ZfcLVvUWONCas8=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=../assets/javascript/script.js></script></body></html>
