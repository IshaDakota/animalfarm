    <p>In Animal Farm, by George Orwell, there are multiple correlations between the plot in the book and the events that took place in Europe from the time of the Russian revolution through World War II. On this website, you will see a presentation of Animal Farm characters and who they symbolize in history. Based on research done by our group, we can tell that — either directly or indirectly — this book was influenced by current events and historic leaders at the time of its writing.</p>
