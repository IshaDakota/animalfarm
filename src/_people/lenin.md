Vladimir Lenin was one of the most, if not THE most, influential figures in Russian history, sparking political change prior to the Russian Revolution. He played a crucial role in the Revolution, introducing new political theories and bringing socialism from just a mere thought to a working and running government. He single handedly created an ideology, which would sweep the 20th century and change the global political landscape as well as the global power dynamic. There are similarities between Old Major and Lenin. Old Major was a wise elder, who wanted to pass his honest ideas and wisdom onto the younger generation. With his knowledge and ideas of equality among workers on the Farm, he sparked a revolution. Like Lennon, who is considered to be the father of socialism, Old Major is considered to be the father of Animal Farm.
