After the Russian Revolution, Leon Trotsky was accused by Joseph Stalin of betraying the working party of the Soviet Union. He was forced into exile until he was assassinated by an NKVD Agent sent by Stalin. After the Battle of Cowshed, Snowball, a leader within the farm, was starting to become disliked by Napoleon for all of his liberal and new ideas. Snowball was a direct threat to Napoleon’s power. Once this became apparent, Napoleon, like Stalin, used multiple tactics to dilute Snowball’s leadership, but in the end, forced Snowball off the farm and into exile, like Trotsky. All the farm animals assumed Snowball had died.
