After the Russian Revolution Leon Trotsky was an influential political leader was accused by Joseph Stalin of betraying the working party of the Soviet Union, therefore, putting himself in exile until he was assassinated by an NKVD Agent sent by Stalin. After the battle of cowshed Snowball, an already influential leader within the farm was starting to become disliked by napoleon for all of his liberal and new ideas. This made him a threat to Napoleonâ€™s power. Once this came to be apparent with him napoleon used multiple different tactics but in the end forced Snowball to hide from him in his workshop. One day during a Sunday meeting snowball was chased off the farm by dogs and we are only left to assume that he died.
