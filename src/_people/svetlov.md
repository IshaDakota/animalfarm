Mikhail Arkadyevich Svetlov was the main Soviet propaganda maker during World War II. He was a crucial piece of Stalin’s plan to keep Russian citizens on his side during the war. Through propaganda, Svetlov spread lies about bloodthirsty, “home ladies” drinking the blood of deceased humans. This spread fear throughout the Soviet Union causing resounding support for Stalin’s cause ,all thanks to Svetlov. Similarities can be made to Animal Farm’s Squealer. Squealer was one of the main sources for “new information” and interpretation of Napoleon’s actions and remarks. He also spread rumors about how filthy humans are and how if they take the Farm back, they will mistreat all of the animals. This instilled resounding fear in the farm animals, shaping their ideas toward working harder and defending the farm.
