Mikhail Arkadyevich Svetlov was the main Soviet propaganda maker during World War Two. He was a crucial part of Stalin’s plan to keep the Russian citizens on his side during the war. The propaganda he made spread lies about bloodthirsty, “home ladies” drinking the blood of deceased humans. This spread fear all throughout the Soviet Union causing resounding support for Stalin’s cause all thanks to Mikhail Arkadyevich Svetlov. Similarities can be made to Animal Farm’s Squealer. Squealer was one of the main sources for new information regarding Napoleons actions and remarks. He also spread rumors about how filthy the humans are and how if they take the farm back they will mistreat all of the animals. This instilled resounding fear in the farm animals making their priorities more aimed towards working and defending the farm.
