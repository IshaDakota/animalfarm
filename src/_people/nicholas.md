Before the Russian Revolution, Russia was fighting in World War I. This impacted its government and its people in many ways including food rationing, extra taxes for the Czar, and the war draft. The citizens of Russia generally thought that World War I was a senseless conflict of which they did not want to be a part. When Czar Nicholas II ignored calls to pull out of the war, his Russian citizens rebelled. They began protesting in rallies and marches all over Russia to express their views. This sent a clear message to Nicholas that the war must be stopped. Once again, Nicholas persisted in the war. The protests became violent and the Russian people began to carry signs saying, “Down with Nicholas.” After Russia was forced out of the war there was a siege of the Russian Palace resulting with Nicholas and his family in jail. This correlates to the beginning of Animal Farm when the animals began to rebel against their treatment by Mr. Jones and against his rules and leadership. Like the Russians did to Nicholas, the animals forcefully removed Mr. Jones from the Farm.
