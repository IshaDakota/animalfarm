After the Russian Revolution during WWII the U.S. really relied on the Soviet Union continuously throughout the war. Then after the war, the U.S.S.R. started to cheat the rest of the Allied powers making the relationship between the super powers very rocky. The same thing happened in Animal Farm when Napoleon sold promised wood to a different buyer cheating Mr. Pilkingtonâ€™s farm then whenever Napoleon tried to patch relations with him all tries were denied.
