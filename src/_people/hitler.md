There is a correlation between Animal Farmâ€™s Fredrick and Adolf Hitler. When Fredrick bought timber from Napoleon in exchange for not attacking the Farm, it is symbolic of the Non-Aggression Pact signed between the U.S.S.R and Hitler at the beginning of World War II. After Fredrick attacked the Animal Farm, he broke the mutual agreement that the two farms shared much like the Germans did during WWII when Hitler attacked the U.S.S.R. despite signing the Pact.
