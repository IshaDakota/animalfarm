When Fredrick buys the timber from Napoleon it is a symbolism of the non-aggression pact signed between the U.S.S.R and Hitler. After Mr. Fredrick attacked the Animal farm he broke the mutual relationship that the two farms shared. Same as in WWII when Hitler attacked the U.S.S.R he started the eastern from breaking the relationship that the two countries once had.
