The main working party in Soviet Russia was the Proletariat movement they are the ones that did the real grueling work due to them believing in Marxism and socialism. They were behind the rise of the Soviet Union and how it sustained its power at the top. Showing these traits is Boxer. The mule on the farm doing the heavy work always chanting. “Must work harder.” This is showing that he knows that Napoleon relies on his work, therefore giving him a sense of pride moving forward.
