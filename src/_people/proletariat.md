The main working party in Soviet Russia was the Proletariat movement . The Proletariats had a deep belief and faith in Marxism and socialism. Therefore, they did the most grueling work without complaint. The Proletariats were behind the rise of the Soviet Union and their dedication sustained the Soviet machine. On Animal Farm, Boxer was the Proletariat. Boxer was the Farm’s hard-working, naive, and most uneducated horse. He was the laborer, always chanting, “Must work harder.” He knew that that Napoleon relied on his work and that gave him a sense of pride in his role on the Farm.
