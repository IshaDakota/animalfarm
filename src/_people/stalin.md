After the Russian Revolution, the U.S.S.R. was left leaderless. It was at that vulnerable point that Stalin ceased the opportunity and rode the momentum to take power over the country to implement a socialist government. There is a similarity to this rise of power for both Napoleon and Snowball. Napoleon is similar to Stalin while Snowball is similar to Leon Trotsky. Trotsky supported Permanent Revolution just like Snowball advocated overthrowing other farm owners. Stalin supported socialism in one country similar to Napoleon's idea of teaching the animals to use firearms. Napoleon drove Snowball off the farm and stole his windmill idea much like Stalin drove Trotsky to exile and stole his industrialization idea. Napoleon turned out to be no different than Mr. Jones in the end: a dictator.
