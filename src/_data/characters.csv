Much like Napoleon the pig Stalin ceased the opportunity and took power over the farm creating a socialist government.,3,Joseph Gobbler,/assets/images/characters/nii.jpg,Squealer,/assets/images/characters/boi.jpg,"Just like the work of Joseph Gobbler the maker of propaganda against the Nazi’s.

After the battle of cowshed Snowball an already influential leader within the farm was starting to become disliked by napoleon for all of his liberal and new ideals.
