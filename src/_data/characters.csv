Much like Napoleon the pig Stalin ceased the opportunity and took power over the farm creating a socialist government.3,Joseph Goebbels,goebbels.jpg,Squealer,squeeker.jpg,"Just like the work of Joseph Goebbels the maker of propaganda against the Nazi’s. Squealer, a loyal to napoleon really worked at the forefront to villainize the human race."4,Leon Trotsky,trotsky.jpg,Snowball,snowball.jpg,"After the Russian Revolution Leon Trotsky was an influential political leader was accused by Joseph Stalin of betraying the working party of the Soviet Union therefore, putting himself in exile until he was assassinated by a NKVD Agent sent by Stalin. After the battle of cowshed Snowball an already influential leader within the farm was starting to become disliked by napoleon for all of his liberal and new ideals. This made him a threat to Napoleon’s power. Once this came to be apparent with him napoleon used multiple different tactics but in the end forced Snowball to hide from him in his workshop. One day during a Sunday meeting snowball was chased off the farm by dogs and we are only left to assume that he died."5,Vladamir Lenin,lenin.jpg,Old Major,oldmajor.jpg,Vladimir Lenin was one of the most if not the most influential figure in Russia sparking change in power. Just as Old major did his final days.6,Proletariet Movement,proletariet.jpg,Boxer,boxer.jpg,The main working party in Soviet Russia was he Proletariat movement they are the ones that did the real grueling work due to them believing in Marxism. Showing these traits is Boxer. The mule on the farm doing the heavy work.7,Hitler,hitler.jpg,Fredrick,fredrick.jpg,When Fredrick buys the timber from Napoleon it is a symbolism of the non-aggression pact signed between the U.S.S.R and Hitler. After Mr. Fredrick attacked the Animal farm he broke the mutual relationship that the two farms shared. Same as in WWII when Hitler attacked the U.S.S.R he started the eastern from breaking the relationship that the two countries once had.8,Bourgeoisie,bourgeoisie.jpg,Molly,molly.jpg,"Bourgeoisie are representative of the Russian elite who fled, and went to capitalist countries to keep their riches and good lives. A good representation of the character Mollie as well, she left for the treatment she once had under Mr. Jones’s rule."9,US and Britain,usbritain.jpg,Pilkington,pilkington.jpg,After the Russian Revolution during WWII the U.S. really relied on the Soviet Union continuously throughout the war. Then after the war the U.S.S.R. started to cheat the rest of the Allied powers making the relationship between the super powers very rocky. The same thing happened in Animal Farm when Napoleon sold promised wood to a different buyer cheating Mr. Pilkington’s farm then whenever Napoleon tried to patch relations with him all tries were denied.
